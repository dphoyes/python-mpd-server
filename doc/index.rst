Welcome to python-mpd-server's documentation!
=============================================
.. include:: readme.rst

How to use it
-------------
An example of a basic use is available in :ref:`example`.

python-mpd-server library defines a default server in :mod:`mpdserver` module
and some defaults commands in :mod:`command_skel` module.

To launch the server, you just have to create a Mpd object ::

   mpd=mpdserver.Mpd(listening_port)

This simulates a dummy mpd server which works with sonata, mpc and gmpc.
To bind an existing player with mpd commmand, you then have to redefine commands.
For example, to bind play command with your player ::

    class Play(mpdserver.Command):
        def handle_args(self):yourplayer.play()
    mpdserver.MpdRequestHandler.commands['play']=Play
